# restaurant-tips-analysis

This project is aimed at analyzing a dataset containing information about tips earned by employees at a restaurant. The dataset contains the following columns:
- Date
- Shift (lunch/dinner)
- Name of employee
- Amount of tips earned
- Training day (Y/N)
- Sick day (Y/N)

The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:
- What is the average amount of tips earned per shift?
- What is the trend of tips over time?
- Is there a relationship between the day of the week and the amount of tips earned?
- Are there any specific times of day or week when the restaurant tends to earn more tips?
- Are there any specific employees that tend to earn more tips than others?
